# Make Graph Neural Networks Great Again: A Generic Integration Paradigm of Topology-Free Patterns for Traffic Speed Prediction (IJCAI 2024)
This is the origin Pytorch implementation of [Make Graph Neural Networks Great Again: A Generic Integration Paradigm of Topology-Free Patterns for Traffic Speed Prediction]() 

## Key Points of DCST
### 1.Spatial-Temporal Scale Generation
Figure 1: Spatial-Temporal Scale. **(a) Spatial Scale:** The features of nodes located in the same grid are aggregated, and different scales are divided according to the size of the grid. **(b) Temporal Scale:** For each node, aggregate the features of time points within the same temporal segment and divide them into different scales based on the length of the temporal segment.
